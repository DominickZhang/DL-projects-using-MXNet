## File List

- **dependencies**: folder of files that contain useful or frequently used functions

- **params**: folder of files that are saved parameters of certain structures of deep neural networks(DNN). Their names are in the form of "Name of the DNN".params.save

- **pics**: folder of files that are pictures or some output files

- **reference**: folder of reference papers

- **GAN_MNIST.py**: use MNIST dataset to train GAN model defined in **GAN.py**

- **GAN.py**: define the model of GAN

- **VAE_MNIST.py**: use MNIST dataset to train VAE model defined in **VAE.py**

- **VAE_TEST.py**: load existing parameters for VAE model defined in **VAE.py** to show the performance of VAE

- **VAE.py**: define the model of VAE
